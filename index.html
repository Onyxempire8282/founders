                        <p>I didn't build Claim Cipher because I wanted to start a software company.</p>
                        <p>I built it because managing high-volume claims across multiple firms without burning out requires more than hustle — it requires systems.</p>
                        <p>Over the years, I've worked with a growing number of TPAs. The work came, the volume came, and eventually the realization came too: Scaling solo has a ceiling.</p>
                        <p>Routes stack. Admin multiplies. Total loss paperwork compounds. And at some point, the friction costs more than the work pays.</p>
                        <p>Claim Cipher began as internal tools — mileage tracking, routing logic, workflow organization — built to make the day-to-day manageable. Not polished. Not marketed. Just functional.</p>
                        <p>What became clear over time was this: If the work is going to grow, the system has to grow with it.</p>
                        <p>Claim Cipher is designed to help adjusters and appraisers:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Manage multiple firms without chaos</li>
                            <li>Reduce admin enough to delegate responsibly</li>
                            <li>Bring spouses or family members into the business in real ways</li>
                            <li>Build sustainability instead of constant recovery</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This isn't an all-in-one platform. It's a modular survival suite built by someone still in the work.</p>
                        <p>I shared this first with a private community that played a real role in my growth. I'm sharing it here now because I know many of you are navigating the same pressures — volume, responsibility, and the desire to build something that lasts.</p>
                        <p>If you want to see how I've actually been working and managing this volume, I recorded a short walkthrough here:</p>
                        <p><a href="#" class="watch-link">Watch the walkthrough</a></p>
                        <p>No hype. No pressure. Just proof of work.</p>
